       TOS14FX5.PRG, a modified TOS14FIX.PRG
       --------------------------------------

The TOS14FX5 patch is installed in the auto folder. It replaces
the original TOS14FIX from ATARI, which still has got some bugs.
TOS14FX5 only runs with original TOS 1.4.

My version uses XBRA, installs an entry in the cookie jar and
fixes another TOS error. And the main feature: I will work on
new fixes if neccassary.

If you use virus detectors:
---------------------------
It is normal for TOS14FIX and TOS14FX5 that the reset-, xbios and
linef trap handler is in the memory region $600 to $800. So ignore
the warnings. In this TOS14FX5 version the vectrs point to:

     Vector | Adress
     -------+--------
     Reset  | $614
     Xbios  | $632
     LineF  | $716
     GemDos | $79C


TOS 1.4 clones:
---------------
There are some special TOS versions, that are build upon TOS 1.4.
The TOS14FIX patch does not run on these versions, because in
the rsconf-call (To configure the RS232 interface) it directly 
jumps into the ROM code. The special TOS versions don't need 
the TOS14FX5 patch, because the errors are fixed in the TOS itself. 

The versions of TOS14FXn
------------------------
  Version 1.0, Berlin 1989
  ------------------------
After the XBRA standard (A standard for programs that change system
vectors) reached germany, i was not very happy that a patch that was
neccassary to run TOS 1.4 did not use the standard. So i made a
little change in the TOS14FIX. 

  Version 1.1, Berlin 19.03.90
  ----------------------------
Someone found a bug in the original TOS14FIX and posted the bug report
to the fido-net. I corrected the bug in my version.

The error occurs if Rsconf(-2,x,x,x,) is called. (This call should return
the baud rate.) The ATARI crashes, because the trap exception ended with
RTS (Return Subroutine) and not RTE (Return exception).

  Version 1.2, Berlin 12.04.90
  ----------------------------
If the  Mshrink-function is called with a new length of NULL, the
TOS 1.4 makes a wrong entry in the internal memory-free-list. After
the end of a program this error is magically restored (I don't know
the internal code...). The Mshrink-error comes up, if you start a
program from the TEMPUS editor and previously had no text loaded.
I found this error in november 89, when i developped the ATARI 
system monitor SysMon. I thougt this error is corrected by the
poolfix code, but someone in the fido net told that this error
is not fixed. I did a test and even if poolfix was installed, the
bug occured. So i build a bugfix into TOS14FX2.

  Version 1.3, Berlin 23.04.90
  ----------------------------
TOS14FX3 installs a Cookie with ID TFI, if a cookie jar is
present. The value of the cookie is the version number.

  Version 1.4, Berlin 09.12.90
  ----------------------------
The modular controlpanel XControl.Acc showed an error in my (not
the original code!) version of TOS14FX3. This error was fixed in
TOS14FX4.

  Version 1.5, Berlin 18.01.91
  ----------------------------
Michael Ziegler (GEM RZ/SZ) found an error in the TT-TOS 3.01
that made it impossible to set the handshake with the function
Rsconf. (The variable was copied as word not as byte, so the
Handshake value is written into the wrong system variable...)
A workaround was to call rsconf with the value in the low AND
hightbyte, but TOS14FIX and TOS14FX4 didn't thake this value.
(Allowed values are in range 0..2, not $0202). The new TOS14FX5
version runs with this workaround, because the test code was
changed to wipe out the highbyte.
