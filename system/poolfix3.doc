Atari Corp., January 19, 1990

There is a rare bug in Rainbow TOS (1.4) and STe TOS (1.6) involving
the way GEMDOS handles its internal memory.  You probably have never
seen this bug, and if you use this patch program, you never will.

Place POOLFIX3.PRG in your AUTO folder and reboot your machine.  That's
all there is to it.  POOLFIX3.PRG will run every time you boot your
machine, so the bug will never ever bite you.

You might get a message to the effect that it must run first in the
AUTO folder.  If this happens, copy the programs from your AUTO folder
to another place and erase them all from the AUTO folder.  Now copy
POOLFIX3.PRG into your AUTO folder, and then all the other programs
which were there.

(A version of this patch was released January 10; it didn't work, and
shouldn't be used.  Another was released January 18; it didn't work
either. (Look, I'm only human!)  This is Take 3.)

**********************************************************************

If you are interested in the technical details of why this program
is necessary and what it does, read on:

The bug doesn't bite very often.  You probably haven't ever seen it. 
It happens when programs use Malloc a lot and you have a lot of folders
in your system.  (Yes, this bug was introduced as part of the code
which got rid of the 40-folder limit.)

The OS pool is the internal memory used by GEMDOS to keep track of
directories, files, handles, and internal memory.  Sometimes, GEMDOS
uses only part of a block.  When there are two blocks that are only
partly used, and the used parts would fit into one block, the space
can be compacted to create one completely used block and one free
block.

Unfortunately, there's a bug in the compaction routine.  This patch
prevents that compaction routine from being executed, by doing the
compaction (with a bug-free routine) before GEMDOS has a chance to.

This code runs before every GEMDOS call.  It uses a flag to tell
whether it needs to run the compaction routine before it lets GEMDOS
handle the call.  If the call is one of the Pterm calls, or an Mfree()
call, it sets the flag so the compaction will run before the NEXT
Gemdos call:

	new gemdos entry point:

		if (flag is set)
			run compact;

		if (call is Mfree or one of the Pterm calls)
			set the flag;
		else
			clear the flag;

		jump to the original gemdos entry point;


The compaction routine runs through GEMDOS's internal memory using
unpublished variables (don't you dare use them yourself!) and compacts
empty space out of the memory blocks, so the routine inside GEMDOS
never finds any space to compact, and the incorrect code never runs.
