# TOSPATCH

This directory contains the [TOSPATCH](https://github.com/markusheiden/tospatch) tool, along with
several useful patches. See the included documentation
on how to use it.

This program was not written by me, but most of the
patch files have been updated so they can be used with
other language versions than german. There are also
now new folders for versions 1.06 and 1.62.

# Known BUGS

 * None :)

# Future

Most of the patches that can be applied can also be activated when
compiling the source. See the file
[patchdef.h](/common/patchdef.h) for available options.
